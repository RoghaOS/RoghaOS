### RoghaOS
Two words from the Irish language.

Rogha meaning choice, freedom. RoghaOS is an operating system for PCs and a firmware for IoT devices, focusing on giving users and administrators freedom to use their OS the way they intend.

Eolas means knowledge, information. We mean access to information and knowledge, from the basic things online to the OSes Heart source code.

RoghaOS was initially imagined being used as a universal Operating System for Education Institutions, being easy to manage and deploy to many devices.

### Goal
Our Vision is to provide something you can rely and depend on. Rogha will not change all the time and have a waterfall of frequent versions like other OSes do.

This way you can use your time for things that matter the most, your creations, your control and your management.

It doesn’t matter your profession or area, RoghaOS is made for everyone.

For people who simply want to turn their device on and be productive without having to find out where a button had moved to.

Giving you the choice to thinker with the OS and change things if you like.

With RoghaOS we aim to produce a robust, modular, flexible and stable platform that respects your rights and your choice.

### Ideal
The choice to choose and do things the way you want. Or simply the choice of leaving things just the way they are and not changing them.

RoghaOS will not ever go thorough any major change that would affect your workflow. We understand and care about the way you do your work.

Make a shell script to automate a task or port a game to RoghaOS and rest assured, it will still work just the way you intended for many years to come.

### Design
We are committed to provide a reliable and consistent experience to everyone running RoghaOS.

Learn Once Use Many. Learn and train for the OS once and use it for many times and many years. This is in constrast with some other Operating Systems that have drastically changed their user interface over ther years.

RoghaOS is committed to a stable GUI design

### Structure
RoghaOS have two main parts
Eolas the bottom layer, which is where the Kernel, Drivers, APIs and low-level stuff lives, it has no GUI (Graphical User Interface). It is text based, intended to be used remotely, IoT applications and as well NAS (Network Attached Storage) and Firewall applications.

The GUI is called Rogha, similar to the whole Operating System but without the “OS” part.
